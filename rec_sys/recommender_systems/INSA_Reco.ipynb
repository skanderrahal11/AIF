At their core, they specialize in handling high-dimensional data, allowing for efficient similarity searches—something traditional databases struggle with. This makes them invaluable for tasks like recommendation systems, image searches, and semantic text retrieval. Beyond search efficiency, vector databases are designed for scalability, capable of handling billions of vectors without a hitch. Furthermore, they often come with built-in mechanisms for distributed storage and computation, ensuring data resilience and fast query speeds even as data volumes grow. In essence, vector databases are the backbone that empowers many of the AI-driven solutions we see today.  \n",
        "For our current session, we're aiming for simplicity and efficiency. Many of the standard vector databases, like [Milvus](https://milvus.io/) or [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/), require their own dedicated installations and often need to run on separate servers or containers.  \n",
        "This can introduce added complexity. Instead, we're turning to [Annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy) a straightforward library developped by Spotify that lets us perform efficient neighbor searches without the installation and server overhead. While Annoy is great for our present needs, do keep in mind that in larger, production scenarios, the capabilities of a dedicated vector database could be invaluable."
